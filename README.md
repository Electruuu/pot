# Pot | Bigos Engine
A game Engine made for Bigos 3 or any other browser 2D game.
It's made to be flexible and easy to understand and build upon. It won't be made with performance in mind
Currently it's in a very early development stage.

## Core principles
Engine uses Objects and Components for everything.
Objects can have multiple components inside of them.

This way, you can build very modular things!

## License
Currently it doesn't have any license, sorry. I need some time to decide on that, but don't worry it will likely be a quite permissive license.
